Airbnb Clone Backend User Stories
Overview
The user-stories/ directory contains documentation for the user stories of the Airbnb Clone backend, as part of the alx-airbnb-project-documentation repository. The user stories translate interactions from the use case diagram into actionable requirements, focusing on core functionalities like user registration, property booking, and payments.
Files

user-stories.md: A Markdown document listing user stories derived from the use case diagram in use-case-diagram/use_case_diagram.md.
user_stories_diagram.png: A PNG file exported from Draw.io, visualizing the user stories as a diagram.

Purpose
The user-stories.md document defines user stories in the format: As a [role], I want to [action] so that [benefit]. It includes:

User registration, login, and profile management.
Property booking, payment processing, and search.
Property listing creation and review submission.
Acceptance criteria for testing and implementation.

The user_stories_diagram.png visualizes these stories, showing how actors (Guest, Host, Admin) interact with the system.
Usage

Review User Stories:
Open user-stories.md to read the user stories and acceptance criteria.
Use the document to guide backend development and ensure all interactions are implemented.


Visualize Diagram:
View user_stories_diagram.png to see the user stories diagram.
Use Draw.io to edit the diagram if needed (import the PNG or recreate from user-stories.md).


Implementation:
Align development with the MySQL schema in database-script-0x01/schema.sql.
Test functionalities using sample data in database-script-0x02/seed.sql.
Refer to features-and-functionalities/features.md for feature details and use-case-diagram/use_case_diagram.md for the source use cases.



Draw.io Instructions
To recreate or edit the user_stories_diagram.png:

Open Draw.io (diagrams.net) and select a blank diagram.
Add stick figures for actors (Guest, Host, Admin).
Add rectangular nodes for each user story (e.g., "Register as Guest/Host").
Connect actors to user stories with solid lines.
Optionally group stories by category (e.g., User Management, Booking Management).
Export the diagram as a PNG named user_stories_diagram.png.
Store the file in the user-stories/ directory.

Notes

Database: The backend uses MySQL with CHAR(36) for IDs and VARCHAR with CHECK constraints, as defined in database-script-0x01/schema.sql.
Visualization: The user_stories_diagram.png is a static export. Recreate in Draw.io using user-stories.md for modifications.
Repository: Commit and push user-stories.md and user_stories_diagram.png to the user-stories/ directory in the alx-airbnb-project-documentation repository.git add user-stories/
git commit -m "Add user stories and diagram for Airbnb Clone backend"
git push origin main


Dependencies: Ensure the MySQL database is set up with the schema before testing user stories.
