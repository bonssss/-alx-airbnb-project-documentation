Airbnb Clone Backend Features and Functionalities
This document outlines the key features and functionalities required for the Airbnb Clone backend, categorized into Core Functionalities, Technical Requirements, and Non-Functional Requirements. It serves as a guide for creating a scalable, secure, and robust backend system.
Core Functionalities
1. User Management

User Registration
Allow users to sign up as guests or hosts.
Require fields: email, password, first name, last name, role (guest/host/admin).
Use secure JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.
Validate email uniqueness and password strength.


User Login and Authentication
Support login via email and password.
Implement OAuth integration (e.g., Google, Facebook) for alternative login.
Generate JWT tokens for secure session management.


Profile Management
Allow users to update profile details (e.g., first name, last name, phone number, profile photo).
Support preferences (e.g., notification settings).
Ensure secure updates with authentication checks.



2. Property Listings Management

Add Listings
Enable hosts to create property listings.
Required fields: title, description, location, price per night, amenities, availability dates.
Support multiple images per listing.


Edit/Delete Listings
Allow hosts to update listing details (e.g., price, description).
Enable hosts to delete listings.
Restrict edits/deletions to authorized hosts only.



3. Search and Filtering

Search Functionality
Allow users to search properties by location, price range, number of guests, and amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly).
Support keyword-based search for titles/descriptions.


Filtering and Sorting
Filter results by price, guest capacity, or amenities.
Sort results by price, rating, or availability.


Pagination
Implement pagination for large datasets to improve performance.



4. Booking Management

Booking Creation
Allow guests to book properties for specific dates.
Validate availability to prevent double bookings.
Calculate total price based on price per night and duration.


Booking Cancellation
Enable guests or hosts to cancel bookings based on a cancellation policy.
Update booking status and notify relevant parties.


Booking Status
Track statuses: pending, confirmed, canceled, completed.
Ensure status transitions are logical (e.g., pending to confirmed).



5. Payment Integration

Payment Processing
Integrate secure payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
Support upfront payments by guests.
Handle automatic payouts to hosts post-booking.


Currency Support
Support multiple currencies for global accessibility.


Payment Tracking
Record payment details (amount, date, method).
Link payments to bookings for audit purposes.



6. Reviews and Ratings

Review Submission
Allow guests to submit reviews and ratings (1-5) for properties after a booking.
Require review to be linked to a completed booking.


Host Responses
Enable hosts to respond to guest reviews.


Review Validation
Prevent fake reviews by restricting to verified bookings.



7. Notifications System

Email Notifications
Send emails for booking confirmations, cancellations, and payment updates.
Use services like SendGrid or Mailgun.


In-App Notifications
Provide in-app alerts for booking status changes or new messages.


Notification Preferences
Allow users to customize notification settings.



8. Admin Dashboard

User Management
Allow admins to view, edit, or suspend user accounts.


Listing Management
Enable admins to review and approve/remove listings.


Booking Oversight
Monitor booking statuses and resolve disputes.


Payment Monitoring
Track payment transactions and handle refunds.



Technical Requirements
1. Database Management

Relational Database
Use MySQL (as specified) for data storage.
Tables: Users, Properties, Bookings, Payments, Reviews, Messages.


Schema Design
Enforce primary keys (CHAR(36) for IDs), foreign keys, and constraints (UNIQUE, NOT NULL, CHECK).
Index key columns (e.g., email, property_id) for performance.



2. API Development

RESTful APIs
Expose endpoints for user management, property listings, bookings, payments, reviews, and messages.
Use HTTP methods: GET (retrieve), POST (create), PUT/PATCH (update), DELETE (remove).
Return proper status codes (e.g., 200, 201, 400, 404).


Optional GraphQL
Support complex queries (e.g., nested property and review data).



3. Authentication and Authorization

JWT Authentication
Generate and validate JWT tokens for secure user sessions.


Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Differentiate permissions for guests, hosts, and admins.
Restrict actions (e.g., only hosts can edit their listings).



4. File Storage

Cloud Storage
Use AWS S3 or Cloudinary for storing property images and profile photos.
Ensure secure access with signed URLs or access controls.



5. Third-Party Services

Email Services
Integrate SendGrid or Mailgun for reliable email notifications.


Payment Gateways
Use Stripe or PayPal for secure payment processing.



6. Error Handling and Logging

Global Error Handling
Implement centralized error handling for APIs (e.g., handle 400, 500 errors).


Logging
Log API requests, errors, and critical events for debugging and auditing.



Non-Functional Requirements
1. Scalability

Modular Architecture
Use a modular design (e.g., MVC) for easy maintenance and scaling.


Horizontal Scaling
Support load balancers to handle increased traffic.



2. Security

Data Protection
Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment info) using industry-standard algorithms.


API Security
Implement rate limiting and firewalls to prevent abuse.


Input Validation
Sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.



3. Performance Optimization

Caching
Use Redis for caching frequent queries (e.g., search results, property listings).


Query Optimization
Optimize database queries with indexes and efficient joins.


Response Time
Ensure API responses are fast (e.g., < 200ms for cached data).



4. Testing

Unit Testing
Use pytest for unit tests on core functions (e.g., booking validation).


Integration Testing
Test API endpoints and database interactions.


Automated Testing
Implement automated tests for all RESTful endpoints.



Draw.io Visualization Instructions
